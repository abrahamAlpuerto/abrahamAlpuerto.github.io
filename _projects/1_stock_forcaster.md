**Role:** Lead Quantitative Researcher & Backend Engineer (3-person Agile Team)

This project focuses on the development and deployment of a specialized time-series forecasting engine designed to predict equity price volatility. Unlike purely theoretical academic projects, this system was **validated with real capital** in a live market environment. 

Working in a small team, we created a full-stack solution from raw data ingestion to signal generation—demonstrating the ability to bridge the gap between "test-set accuracy" and real-world performance.

### Real-World Performance
* **Quantitative Success:** The model achieved a **< 2% Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)** on the 40-day prediction window, a result considered exceptional by industry standards for mid-cap equities.
* **Capital Efficiency:** In a 2-month live-fire test, the strategy generated a **660% Return on Investment (ROI)**, scaling a test account from **$300 to $2,000** through automated signal execution. Achieving this aggressive return, we trained the forcaster to predict 10 days in the future to execute quicker options trades instead of longer term holds.
* **Strategy:** The system successfully identified non-obvious entry points by weighing long-term dependencies against short-term volatility.

### The Data Pipeline
To support the model, I engineered a robust data pipeline capable of handling noisy financial data.
1.  **Data Gathering:** Used yfinance to gather **10 years of daily time-series data** for 50+ target equities.
2.  **Cleaning:** Implemented automated cleaning protocols to handle missing ticks, stock splits, and dividends, ensuring data integrity before training.
3.  **Feature Engineering:** Enriched the dataset with **18 distinct predictive indicators** (technical and statistical) to expand the feature space for the neural network.
4.  **Normalization**: Normalized the dataset with a MinMax scaler from -1,1 to prevent higher weight on larger features.

### Technical Architecture
The core of the system is a custom deep learning model built with **TensorFlow** and **Keras**.
* **Custom Model Architecture:** I engineered a **custom Attention Layer subclass** rather than using off-the-shelf components, integrating it with **LSTM networks** to mathematically weigh the relevance of historical volatility against current price action.
* **Optimization & Training:** Implemented dynamic **Learning Rate Scheduling** and **Early Stopping** callbacks to optimize convergence and prevent overfitting on noise.
* **Feature Engineering:** The system aggregates over a decade of daily time-series data, generating **18 distinct predictive indicators** (including VWAP, Aroon, and Bollinger Bands) to enrich the feature space.
