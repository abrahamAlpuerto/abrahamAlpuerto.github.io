I am a Computer and Systems Engineering student at **Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI)**, currently transitioning into the accelerated Master's of Science program (Spring 2026). I specialize in **Applied Machine Learning** and **AI Systems Engineering**. My focus is on bridging the gap between experimental AI models and scalable, production-ready software. I am particularly interested in **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **Agentic Workflows**, and **Hardware-Software Integration**.

Hey, I am a Computer and Systems Engineering student at **Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI)**, currently transitioning into the accelerated Master's program for admit Spring 2026. My specialization is in applications of **Machine Learning** and **Engineering AI Systems**. I am particulary interested in **Agentic Workflows**, **Forcasting Systems**, **Computer Vision**, and the **Hardware-Software Integrations** applications of AI/ML.

I currently am a research assistant at Columbia Secure FinAI Lab where I just had a paper accepted to the **NeurIPS 2025 Workshop**. At the lab most of my work involves working on an AI agent that leverages a knowledge base database, multi-agent communications like MCP and A2A protocols, and fine-tuning with parameter efficient techniques.

When I am not doing all this I like to work on side projects, play volleyball, enjoy the outdoors, spend time friends, and chill out with my dogs.


Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
