  abstract={We propose an end-to-end orchestration framework that democratizes financial intelligence by mapping traditional algorithmic trading components (Data, Alpha, Risk, Portfolio) to specialized AI agents. By utilizing the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for orchestration and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocols for peer communication, we achieve a modular system where LLMs handle reasoning while preventing data leakage. In backtesting on hourly stock data (04/2024–12/2024), our framework achieved a Sharpe ratio of 2.63 compared to the S&P 500's 1.86.}
